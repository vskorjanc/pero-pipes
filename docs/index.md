Perovskite data pipelines (**Pero Pipes** in short) is a project that streamlines common measurements in perovskite research. By combing an assortment of python scripts with data analysis tool [[about-Thot|Thot]], it provides structure and removes friction from data analysis.  

Benefits of using Pero Pipes:  

- saves time
- gives clear structure to the analysed data
- allows for in-depth analysis
