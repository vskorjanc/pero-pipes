# Navigating the docs
The docs were written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a note-taking app that allows for easy interlinking between notes. They are saved in human-readable markdown format and can be opened by virtually any editor, but for additional functionality I recommend installing the application.

The [Breadcrumbs plugin](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/wiki) allows for neat visualization of hierarchical notes. Make sure it's enabled in the right-hand-side pane. 

Click `Open homepage` button on the left-hand side whenever you want to re-open the hierarchy note.

## Tips
| Key combination       | Command                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `<-` | Go to previous open note.                     |
