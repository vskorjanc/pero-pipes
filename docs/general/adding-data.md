# Adding data
It is recommended to use [Thot GUI](https://thot-data-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/install.html) to create and expand the database in a simple and intuitive way.  For the analysis to work, the key is **consistency**:  

- take care about the container hierarchy
- every symbol matters, including e.g. **spaces** and **capital letters**
- input all the necessary **metadata**
- take care about the file names (see [[file-naming-convention|file naming convention]])

!!! warning
    Thot GUI might get slow as the database gets big. It is recommended to add the data in a smaller folder on the local machine and then transfer the folder to the right place in the joint database. 

### Good practices
- insert scripts relative to the `root`
